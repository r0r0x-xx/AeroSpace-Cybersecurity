### Offensive Cybersecurity in Aerospace and Satellite Technology










### **2. Introduction to cybersecurity in satellite technology**

- **Attack surfaces**
    - space segment: satellites and payload systems
    - user segment: ground terminals and user devices
    - link segment: communication channels and rf links
    - ground segment: ground stations and network infrastructure
- **Satellite attacks**
    - examples of past incidents, including sparta as a case study
    - potential vulnerabilities in satellite systems
    - understanding denial-of-service, spoofing, and interception in satellite environments
- **Satellite networks and vulnerabilities**
    - risk analysis of satellite networks
    - vulnerabilities in communication links
    - common exploitation scenarios and their implications

### **3. Tools and techniques**

- **Satellite communication analysis**
    - tools for rf signal interception and analysis
    - examples: gnuradio, sdr-based tools, and satnogs
- **Protocol analysis and testing**
    - tools for analyzing satellite-specific protocols
    - examples: wireshark, ccsds protocol analyzers
- **Satellite hardware and firmware assessment**
    - reverse engineering tools for satellite firmware
    - examples: ida pro, ghidra, binwalk
- **Simulators and emulators**
    - satellite system simulation environments
    - examples: nos3, openatkit
- **Network and ground station testing**
    - tools for network and penetration testing
    - examples: nmap, metasploit, burp suite
- **Custom exploit development**
    - scripting and payload creation for satellite systems
    - examples: python, c, and assembly for low-level interactions
