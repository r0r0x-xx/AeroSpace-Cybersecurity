# An introductory overview of aerospace, satellites, and related topics.

Hey Folks! Over the past three years, I have been self-taught in aerospace technology, dedicating a lot of time to learning and researching this field. This repository is a compilation of ideas, notes, and observations I have gathered during this journey. I have organized the material in a clear and coherent manner (I hope so! XD), starting with satellite technology, followed by general aerospace security, and finally, exploring how to hack satellites. I hope you find this resource useful for enhancing your understanding and knowledge of this fascinating field! :)

## Introduction 

**What is aerospace cybersecurity?**

Aerospace cybersecurity is critical for protecting the integrity of both aircraft and spacecraft operations. In a time when cyber threats are constantly evolving, it is vital to implement strong security measures to safeguard sensitive systems and data within the aerospace sector. By prioritizing aerospace cybersecurity, we can ensure the safety and reliability of our air and space industries, which in turn helps maintain public trust and promotes technological innovation.



# Satellite orbits and technologies

Satellites are objects that orbit around a planet or other celestial bodies. They can be natural, like moons, or artificial, which are man-made devices launched into space for various purposes. Artificial satellites serve many functions, including communication, weather monitoring, navigation, scientific research, and Earth observation.

Satellite orbits describe the paths that satellites travel around celestial bodies like Earth. These paths are shaped by the interplay between the planet's gravitational force and the satellite's velocity. Orbits are key in determining a satellite's purpose, its cover area, and how long it can operate. Technically, orbits are characterized by altitude, inclination, eccentricity, and time to complete a full revolution.


## Types of orbits used in satellite communication

**LEO - Low Earth Orbit**

- Satellite elevation: Between 160 km  and 2,000 km above the Earth's surface.
- **Main characteristics**:
    - Short orbital period: 90 to 120 minutes, allowing multiple daily visits to the same region.
    - The low relative speed for the Earth's surface.
    - High atmospheric drag, especially at altitudes below 500 km, causes more significant orbit degradation and requires propulsion systems to maintain it.
- **key functions:**
    - **Communications constellations:** These are designed to provide global broadband connectivity.
    - **Earth observation satellites**: Include scientific missions that monitor climate change, agricultural activities, and natural disasters.
    - **Spy satellites**: These are used by government agencies due to their high image resolution from low altitudes.
- **Limitations in this orbit**:
    - Need for large constellations for continuous coverage.
    - Increased risk of collisions due to the density of objects in this region.
